This script scrapes all climbing shoes off epic.tv and their prices and puts them into a csv file.

Ideas:
-Automatically monitor shoes for low prices in the correct size
-Compare to other websites
-Find 10 cheapest shoes across a range of websites for certain size


TO DO:
-Filter by size/ price
-If only displaying 10 shoes, include picture?
-Build GUI so anyone can choose their size/ price range
