This script scrapes all climbing shoes off epic.tv and their prices and puts them into a csv file.

Ideas:
-Automatically monitor shoes for low prices in the correct size
-Compare to other websites
-Make website so anyone can access
-Update daily so people just need to filter and not submit the request live


TO DO:
-Filter by size/ price. DONE
    -Need to filter when size is listed but out of stock
-If only displaying 10 shoes, include picture?
-Build GUI so anyone can choose their size/ price range
-Make inputs in cmd line for price, size etc
-open excel on completion
-search for clearance. DONE
-find link. DONE
